There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
    911online

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
    Everyone would benefit from it. They get to contact 911 online. 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
    The product allows anyone who has registered to contact 911 online. 911 emergency help has always been through telephone services and it is time that space will be disrupted. Nowadays most people have access to the internet. To use the product, the user would register and when it comes time where the user feels he/she is in an emergency, they can login and file a request. On the police side, they will get the location of the emergency and also the location (through wifi triangulation/ip address) and quickly deploy officers to the site.  

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
    This product solves 3 problems. The first problem it solves is that it streamlines 911 calls. Traditionally with telephones, there would be multiple operators speaking with the victim. With the internet, those emergency requests can be filed in asynchronously. The second problem this solves is that it saves time. During 911 calls, the victim usually have to report his/her address. This take at least 30 seconds. The operator usually verifies the address also. This valuble time can be eliminated. And lastly, the third problem this product solve is police can query the database of crimes and send officers to the most pertinent crimes at the moment. As many have heard, there was a story where someone called 911 because mcdonald didn't have any more chicken nuggets. The police going to that crime could be saving someone else that is actually in danger. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
    This product solves all three problems because it places all those emergency requests into a database/map. The officers can get all the important information quickly and respond accordingly.  

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "It's time to disrupt the 911 services"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
    To get started, I'm going to build the client side chat platform. I will find out how to get location from the user (maybe we need google geolocation api for accurate location). Afterwards, i'll built the police client side. They will get a map of the location of the crime. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
    "911online saved my life!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
    911online will disrupt traditional 911 phone calls.
